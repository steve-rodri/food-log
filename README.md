# Food Log/Diary

## Description

  The Food log you actually want to use. It has been shown that what you eat holds a large window into your future health. That's why the easier it is to track your food, the more likely you are to actually do so, which provides better insight into your health. This app makes it as simple as possible to do so. Simply type in what you ate, in a natural way..i.e "for lunch I had a sweet potato with half an avocado and a cup of black beans.", and the app will log your food for you, complete with all the metrics your nutritionist will fancy. You can see a detailed overview of all the nutrients of the food you consume. Or It could be simple and you can just see how many calories your eating compared to how much your burning. Either way, this app aims to effortlessly log your food as quick and simple as possible so you can get on with your day.
